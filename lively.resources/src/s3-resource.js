  This is a resource that encapsulates the management of an S3 endpoint.

  of which there are now many more, such as DigitalOcean Spaces, etc.

  lively.resources evaluates to S3Resource automatically by prefixing the url with s3://
  Internally S3Resources manages a plain HttpResource to which it dispatches the approriate HTTP(S) requests as needed.
