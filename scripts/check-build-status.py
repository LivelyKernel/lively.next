# This script checks whether or not the below defined artifacts (`need_to_check_deps`) are up to date.
# An artifact is up to date if its dependecies have not been altered since the last build or if its contents would not change when rebuilding.
# This is checked on a commit basis and should be satisfied before a PR is merged into the main branch.

# Be aware, that this script might run build processes. It is assumed, that this is done in CI and any resulting file changes are thus discarded!
# If you run this locally, the contents of your repository might change!
